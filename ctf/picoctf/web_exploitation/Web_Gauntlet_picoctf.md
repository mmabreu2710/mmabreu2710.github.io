# Challenge "Web Gauntlet" Writeup

## Vulnerability: SQL Injection in Multiple Rounds

### Where: SQL injection across multiple login fields with different filters applied

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how different SQL injection techniques can bypass filtering mechanisms to gain access and ultimately retrieve the flag.

**NOTE**: The challenge consists of 5 rounds, each requiring unique SQL injection techniques to bypass specific filters.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Round 1 and 2**:
   For the first and second rounds, we bypassed the login check with a basic SQL injection:
   
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `a' IS NOT 'b`

   This input bypasses the authentication by evaluating the SQL statement as true regardless of the password.

2. **Round 3**:
   In the third round, we used a comment-based SQL injection to handle different filtering mechanisms:

   - **Username and Password**: `admin'/*`

   This input exploits SQL comments (`/*`) to bypass the remaining parts of the query.

3. **Round 4 and 5**:
   For the fourth and fifth rounds, we refined the SQL injection approach to handle further filtering:

   - **Username and Password**: `ad'||'min'/*`

   This input uses the `||` operator to concatenate the injection string and the `/*` to comment out any remaining SQL.

4. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   After completing all 5 rounds, we visited `filter.php` to view the flag. This page displayed the following flag:

   ```
   picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_a3ed4355668e74af0ecbb7496c8dd7c5}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By adapting different SQL injection techniques to bypass multiple rounds of filtering, we successfully accessed the `filter.php` page and retrieved the flag, completing the challenge.
