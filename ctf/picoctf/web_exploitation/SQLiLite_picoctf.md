# Challenge "SQLiLite" Writeup

## Vulnerability: SQL Injection (SQLi)

### Where: Login form with SQL injection vulnerability in the username field

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how SQL injection can bypass authentication and reveal sensitive information embedded within the page.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves logging in with a crafted SQL injection payload that bypasses the authentication check, allowing access to hidden content.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Inject SQL Payload in Login Form**:
   We used the following SQL injection payload in the username field:

   - **Username**: `a' OR '1'='1' --`
   - **Password**: `a`

   This crafted input allows the SQL query to bypass the password requirement and authenticate the user.

2. **Observe the SQL Query**:
   The server returned the executed SQL query, which confirmed the injection:

   ```
   SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='a' OR '1'='1' --' AND password='a'
   ```

   This query ignores the password check due to the `OR '1'='1'` condition, allowing us to log in.

3. **Locate the Hidden Flag**:
   Upon successful login, the page revealed a hidden HTML element containing the flag:

   ```
   Your flag is: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}
   ```

   The flag was thus visible in the HTML as plain text.

## Conclusion:

By exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in the login form, we bypassed authentication and accessed the hidden flag, completing the challenge.
