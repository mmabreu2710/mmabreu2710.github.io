# Challenge "WebDecode" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Hidden Encoded Information in HTML

### Where: Encoded value hidden in the HTML of the About page

### Impact: The challenge aimed to test the ability to inspect and decode hidden information within a webpage.

**NOTE**: The challenge involved inspecting the source code of a webpage to locate a hidden Base64 encoded string. This string, once decoded, revealed the flag.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Open the Website:** First, I opened the challenge webpage and navigated through the various pages available.

2. **Check Each Page:** I systematically explored each page of the website, paying close attention to any content or clues that might indicate hidden information.

3. **Find a Hint in the "About" Page:** On the "About" page, I noticed a suggestion embedded in the content, prompting me to inspect the pageâ€™s source code.

4. **Inspect the HTML Source:** Using the browser's "Inspect" tool, I examined the HTML and found the following element:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9">
```

5. **Extract and Decode the Value:** The value in the `notify_true` attribute was Base64 encoded. I copied the string and decoded it using a Base64 decoder, which revealed the flag:

```
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_07b91c79}
```

## Conclusion:

By inspecting the source code and decoding the Base64 string, I was able to successfully retrieve the flag and solve the challenge.
