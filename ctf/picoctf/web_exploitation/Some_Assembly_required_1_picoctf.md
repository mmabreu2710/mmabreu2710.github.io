# Challenge "Some Assembly Required 1" Writeup

## Vulnerability: WebAssembly Flag Disclosure

### Where: WebAssembly module embedded in JavaScript on the webpage

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how analyzing a WebAssembly file directly can reveal the flag without needing to bypass application logic.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves downloading a WebAssembly file, inspecting its contents, and retrieving the flag from embedded strings.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Download the WebAssembly Module**:
   The JavaScript code indicated that a WebAssembly file (`JIFxzHyW8W`) is fetched and used to validate the flag input. We downloaded this Wasm file to analyze it locally:

   ```
   wget http://mercury.picoctf.net:26215/JIFxzHyW8W
   ```

2. **Inspect the WebAssembly File**:
   Using the `strings` command, we searched for readable text within the WebAssembly file to find any clues:

   ```
   strings JIFxzHyW8W
   ```

   This revealed several function names, including `check_flag` and `copy_char`, which seemed to be used for flag validation.

3. **Locate the Flag**:
   During the inspection, we found the flag embedded directly within the file output:

   ```
   picoCTF{a8bae10f4d9544110222c2d639dc6de6}
   ```

   This string appeared alongside other function names, suggesting it was hardcoded within the module.

## Conclusion:

By examining the WebAssembly file directly, we found the flag embedded as a string, allowing us to complete the challenge without interacting with the applicationâ€™s input field. This approach bypassed the need to reverse-engineer the flag-checking logic.
