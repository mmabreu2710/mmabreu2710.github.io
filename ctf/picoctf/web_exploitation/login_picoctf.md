# Challenge "Login" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Base64-encoded Credential Check

### Where: Client-side JavaScript authentication with base64-encoded values for username and password

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how encoded (but not encrypted) credentials can be decoded to retrieve sensitive information, such as the flag.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves analyzing the JavaScript code to decode the base64-encoded username and password values.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Inspect the JavaScript Code**:
   In the provided `index.js` file, we found the following base64-encoded checks:

   ```
   "YWRtaW4"!==t.u?alert("Incorrect Username"):"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"!==t.p?alert("Incorrect Password"):void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)
   ```

   This snippet indicates that:
   - The base64-encoded username should match `"YWRtaW4"`.
   - The base64-encoded password should match `"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"`.

2. **Decode the Base64 Values**:
   We decoded each base64 string to obtain the actual credentials:
   - **Username**: `YWRtaW4` decodes to `"admin"`
   - **Password**: `cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ` decodes to `"picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}"`

3. **Enter the Credentials**:
   On the login page, we entered the decoded credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}`

4. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   Upon submitting the form with these credentials, an alert displayed confirming the correct login and revealed the flag:

   ```
   picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By decoding the base64-encoded credentials in the client-side JavaScript, we were able to log in as `admin` and retrieve the flag, successfully completing the challenge.
