# Challenge "findme" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Hidden Redirection and Base64-encoded Flag

### Where: Hidden URL with a base64-encoded flag after login

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how hidden URLs and encoded parameters can contain sensitive information, like a flag, that is retrievable with basic decoding.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves logging in with specified credentials and navigating through the webpage to find an encoded flag.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Log in Using Provided Credentials**:
   The challenge description asked us to log in with the username `test` and password `test!`. After logging in, we found an input field with a search function, but nothing immediately revealing.

2. **Navigate and Inspect Elements**:
   After submitting a search query, we navigated back in the browser history and found ourselves on a new URL:

   ```
   http://saturn.picoctf.net:54790/next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs
   ```

   This URL contains an `id` parameter with the base64-encoded string `cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs`, which appears to be the flag.

3. **Decode the Base64 String**:
   Using a base64 decoder, we decoded the `id` parameter:

   ```
   echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" | base64 -d
   ```

   This returned the decoded string:

   ```
   picoCTF{proxies_al}
   ```

   The decoded string was indeed the flag.

## Conclusion:

By examining the URL after login and decoding the base64-encoded string in the `id` parameter, we were able to retrieve the flag, completing the challenge.
