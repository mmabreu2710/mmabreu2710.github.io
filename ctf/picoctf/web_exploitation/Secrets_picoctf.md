# Challenge "Secrets" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Hidden Paths and Files

### Where: Multiple hidden directories accessible through webpage inspection

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how hidden files and paths can reveal sensitive information, such as a flag, through simple web directory traversal.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves navigating through hidden directories and examining HTML elements to locate the flag.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Inspect the HTML for Clues**:
   Initially, we inspected the page's HTML source and found a path to an image:

   ```
   <img src="secret/assets/DX1KYM.jpg">
   ```

   We navigated to the base directory of this path:

   ```
   http://saturn.picoctf.net:63903/secret/
   ```

   This page displayed a message saying, "Finally. You almost found me. you are doing well."

2. **Continue Following Clues in HTML**:
   Next, we found another reference in the HTML to a CSS file:

   ```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="hidden/file.css">
   ```

   We navigated to:

   ```
   http://saturn.picoctf.net:63903/secret/hidden/
   ```

   This redirected us to a login page, where we inspected the HTML source again.

3. **Discover Another Hidden Directory**:
   On the login page, we found another CSS link:

   ```
   <link href="superhidden/login.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

   Following this link, we navigated to:

   ```
   http://saturn.picoctf.net:63903/secret/hidden/superhidden/
   ```

4. **Locate the Flag**:
   On this final page, we found the flag embedded within an HTML element:

   ```
   <h3 class="flag">picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_51b260fe}</h3>
   ```

   The flag was successfully retrieved as `picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_51b260fe}`.

## Conclusion:

By carefully examining the HTML and following a sequence of hidden paths, we successfully located the flag, completing the challenge.
