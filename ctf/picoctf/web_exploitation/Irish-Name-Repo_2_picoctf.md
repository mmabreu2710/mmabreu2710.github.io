# Challenge "Irish-Name-Repo 2" Writeup

## Vulnerability: SQL Injection on Login Page

### Where: Admin login page with SQL injection vulnerability in username and password fields

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how a SQL injection in the login form can bypass authentication, granting access to restricted content and revealing the flag.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves using SQL injection to bypass the login check and gain access to the admin page.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Navigate to the Admin Login Page**:
   On the main page showing famous Irish people, we found an "Admin Login" link, which brought us to a login page requiring both a username and password.

2. **SQL Injection to Bypass Authentication**:
   - In the username field, we entered `admin'/*`.
   - In the password field, we entered `admin'/*` as well.
   - This SQL injection uses the `/*` comment syntax to ignore the rest of the SQL query after `admin`, effectively bypassing any password verification.

   **Username**: `admin'/*`
   **Password**: `admin'/*`

3. **Access the Admin Page**:
   After entering the injection in both fields, we successfully bypassed the authentication and accessed the admin area, which displayed the flag.

4. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   The page displayed the following flag:

   ```
   picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By injecting SQL syntax into both the username and password fields, we bypassed the authentication, accessed the admin page, and successfully retrieved the flag, completing the challenge.
