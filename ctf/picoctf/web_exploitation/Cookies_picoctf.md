# Challenge "Cookies" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Insecure Cookie-Based Flag Retrieval

### Where: Exploiting cookie values to reveal the flag

### Impact: The challenge tests the ability to manipulate cookie values in order to retrieve the flag from the server.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves manipulating the `name` cookie value to trigger a flag display.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Access the Page:**
   The challenge page asks the user to insert the name of a cookie. The suggestion was the name "snickerdoodle."

2. **Inspect Cookies:**
   After submitting the cookie name, I noticed that the browser's developer tools showed the following cookie being set:

   ```
   Cookie: name=0
   ```

3. **Use Burp Suite to Manipulate the Cookie:**
   I used Burp Suite to intercept the request and sent it to the repeater. I experimented by modifying the `name` cookie value and resending the request multiple times.

4. **Find the Correct Value:**
   After trying a variety of numbers, I discovered that setting the cookie value to `18` triggered a response containing the flag:

   ```html
   <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}</code></p>
   ```

## Conclusion:

By manipulating the `name` cookie value in Burp Suite and setting it to `18`, I was able to retrieve the flag and complete the challenge.
