# Challenge "Irish-Name-Repo 1" Writeup

## Vulnerability: SQL Injection on Login Page

### Where: Admin login page with SQL injection vulnerability in username field

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how a SQL injection in the login form can be used to bypass authentication and gain access to restricted content, revealing the flag.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves injecting SQL syntax to bypass the login check and gain access to the admin page.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Navigate to the Admin Login Page**:
   On the main page displaying famous Irish people, we found an "Admin Login" link. This page required a username and password.

2. **SQL Injection to Bypass Login**:
   - In the username field, we entered `admin'--`.
   - This injection terminates the SQL query after `admin`, ignoring any further conditions that would normally validate the password.

   **Username**: `admin'--`
   **Password**: (left blank)

3. **Access the Admin Page**:
   Using this SQL injection, we bypassed the authentication and accessed the admin section, where the flag was displayed.

4. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   The page displayed the following message with the flag:

   ```
   Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_f8adf3fb}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By injecting SQL syntax into the login form, we bypassed authentication, accessed the admin page, and successfully retrieved the flag.
