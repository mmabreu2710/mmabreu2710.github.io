# Challenge "Where Are the Robots" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Accessible Sensitive File via robots.txt

### Where: The flag was hidden in a disallowed URL listed in the robots.txt file.

### Impact: The challenge tests the ability to find hidden pages by inspecting the `robots.txt` file, which lists URLs that are disallowed for web crawlers but still accessible.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves checking the `robots.txt` file for any disallowed pages and accessing them directly to find the flag.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Check the robots.txt File:**
   I checked the websiteâ€™s `robots.txt` file by navigating to `/robots.txt`. The file contained the following:

   ```
   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /477ce.html
   ```

2. **Access the Disallowed Page:**
   I navigated to the disallowed page `/477ce.html` by entering the URL directly in the browser.

3. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   Upon visiting the page, I found the following message along with the flag:

   ```
   Guess you found the robots
   picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By inspecting the `robots.txt` file and accessing the disallowed URL, I was able to retrieve the flag and complete the challenge.
