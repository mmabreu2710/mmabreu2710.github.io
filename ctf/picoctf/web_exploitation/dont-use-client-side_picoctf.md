# Challenge "dont-use-client-side" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Client-Side Password Disclosure

### Where: The password verification logic is embedded in the client-side JavaScript.

### Impact: The challenge tests the ability to read and reconstruct a password based on client-side validation checks.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves analyzing the JavaScript code to reconstruct the password by looking at how specific substrings are verified.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Inspect the Source Code:**
   Upon loading the login page, I inspected the HTML and JavaScript code. The password verification logic was implemented directly in the `verify()` function, which compared various substrings of the input password with hardcoded values.

2. **Understand the Password Structure:**
   The `verify()` function used multiple substring comparisons to validate the password. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the password:

   - The first 4 characters must be `pico`
   - Characters 4 to 8 must be `CTF{`
   - Characters 8 to 12 must be `no_c`
   - Characters 12 to 16 must be `lien`
   - Characters 16 to 20 must be `ts_p`
   - Characters 20 to 24 must be `lz_1`
   - Characters 24 to 28 must be `a3c8`
   - Characters 28 to 32 must be `9}`

3. **Construct the Password:**
   After analyzing the logic, I reconstructed the password as follows:

   ```
   picoCTF{no_clients_plz_1a3c89}
   ```

4. **Enter the Password:**
   I entered the constructed password into the login form and clicked "Verify." The alert showed "Password Verified," indicating successful login and challenge completion.

## Conclusion:

By reading and analyzing the client-side JavaScript code, I was able to reconstruct the password and successfully complete the challenge.
