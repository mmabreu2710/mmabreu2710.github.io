## Vulnerability: Client-Side Authentication Bypass

### Where: Bypassing username and password checks by manipulating client-side JavaScript

### Impact: The challenge tests the ability to bypass client-side authentication by manually submitting a hidden form.

**NOTE**: The challenge involves inspecting and manipulating the JavaScript to bypass the login process, leading to the successful submission of a hidden form.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Attempt to Log In:**
   I used the credentials `admin` for both username and password. After submitting the form, the response indicated "Login Failed."

2. **Inspect and Manipulate JavaScript:**
   Upon inspecting the source code, I found that there is a hidden form which is automatically submitted upon successful login. The hidden form contains the following code:

   ```html
   <form hidden action="admin.php" method="post" id="hiddenAdminForm">
      <input type="text" name="hash" required id="adminFormHash">
   </form>
   ```

3. **Bypass Login Check:**
   The script fills the `hash` value and submits the form when a successful login is detected. I manually bypassed this login check by entering the following JavaScript code in the browser console:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('adminFormHash').value = "2196812e91c29df34f5e217cfd639881";
   document.getElementById('hiddenAdminForm').submit();
   ```

4. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   After running the above code, the page redirected, and I successfully obtained the flag:

   ```
   picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_05df90c8}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By bypassing the client-side JavaScript login checks, I was able to submit the hidden form and retrieve the flag for the challenge.
