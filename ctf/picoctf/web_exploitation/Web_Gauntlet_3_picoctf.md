# Challenge "Web Gauntlet 3" Writeup

## Vulnerability: SQL Injection with Filtered Keywords

### Where: SQL injection in login fields with specific keyword and character filters

### Impact: This challenge demonstrates how to bypass specific filters on SQL injection keywords and operators to gain access and retrieve the flag.

**NOTE**: The challenge includes keyword and character filtering, requiring creative SQL injection techniques.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Analyze the Filters**:
   The page specified the following filters: 

   ```
   Filters: or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin
   ```

   This filtering blocks common SQL injection keywords, operators, and comments, requiring alternative approaches.

2. **Bypass Authentication**:
   To bypass the authentication, we used a combination of SQL injection techniques:

   - **Username**: `ad'||'min`
   - **Password**: `a' IS NOT 'b`

   This injection avoids the filtered keywords by using the `||` (concatenation operator) to modify the username and `"IS NOT"` to bypass the password check.

3. **Retrieve the Flag**:
   After bypassing the login, we accessed `filter.php` to view the flag. The page displayed the flag:

   ```
   picoCTF{k3ep_1t_sh0rt_2a78ea34c84da0bf585ada4cb9a6f8fb}
   ```

## Conclusion:

By using SQL injection techniques that avoid the filtered keywords, we successfully accessed `filter.php` and retrieved the flag, completing the challenge.
