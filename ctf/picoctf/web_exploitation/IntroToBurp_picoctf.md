# Challenge "IntroToBurp" Writeup

## Vulnerability: Lack of OTP Validation Enforcement

### Where: OTP (Two-Factor Authentication) Bypass via Burp Suite

### Impact: The challenge tests the ability to bypass OTP validation by intercepting and modifying the request.

**NOTE**: The challenge involved exploiting the serverâ€™s failure to enforce OTP validation, allowing an attacker to bypass the two-factor authentication and access the system.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. **Open the Register Page:** I accessed the provided registration page and filled out all required fields, including username, password, and other details.

2. **Encounter the OTP Field:** After completing the form, I reached a field requiring a two-factor authentication (2FA) parameter, specifically an OTP (One-Time Password).

3. **Open Burp Suite to Intercept the Request:** I used Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request that was sent after filling in the OTP field.

4. **Identify the OTP Parameter in the Request:** In the intercepted request, I found the following data:

```
Cookie: session=.eJw9jNsKwjAQRP9ln32IZJO2_kzYTbcotknIhSLivxsh-DZzhjNv8I_6ghsQXMCXvLkanxI6uPKEQnb21oiRVTOqmdiwnpQgYueKUPTP29q-u0CHjJ9YU0-LXZS1vSYq5Yx5HWu6xyAutIMlD9SK5L__-QLKcCxS.Zu8tJw.eSYSt00WaOBQQ22eVCHR7RnFFqY
Connection: keep-alive
otp=aa
```

5. **Modify the Request by Removing the OTP Parameter:** I removed the `otp` parameter entirely from the request and forwarded it without the OTP.

6. **Receive the Flag:** The server responded with a welcome message and the flag, indicating successful bypass of the OTP validation:

```
Welcome, you successfully bypassed the OTP request. Your Flag: picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_e1eb16ed}
```

## Conclusion:

By removing the OTP parameter from the intercepted request and forwarding it, I was able to bypass the two-factor authentication check and obtain the flag for the challenge.
